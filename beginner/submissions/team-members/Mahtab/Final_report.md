# 🟢 Beginner Track

## ✅ Week 1: Setup, EDA & Feature Engineering


### 🛠️ 1. Project Setup & Data Loading

Q: How did you set up your project environment and manage dependencies?  
A:  I created a local Python 3.12.6 virtual environment (.venv) in the project folder and selected .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe as the interpreter in VS Code and Jupyter. I installed dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt and managed package versions using the virtual environment (pip 25.2)

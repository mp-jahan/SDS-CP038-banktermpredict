# 🟢 Beginner Track

## ✅ Week 1: Setup, EDA & Feature Engineering


### 🛠️ 1. Project Setup & Data Loading

Q: How did you set up your project environment and manage dependencies?  
A:  I created a local Python 3.12.6 virtual environment (.venv) in the project folder and selected .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe as the interpreter in VS Code and Jupyter. I installed dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt and managed package versions using the virtual environment (pip 25.2)


Q: What steps did you take to load and inspect the dataset?  
A:
-1) I loaded  the dataset bank_full.csv using pd.read_csv() taking look the first 30 rows thorough .head(30)
-2)  using .shape to confirm the size of df (45211,17)
-3) I verified the structure with .info() which showed 7 numeric(int64) features, including ( age, balance,day,duration,campaign,pdays,previous) and 10 categorical(object) featires including (job,martial,education, housing , loan,contact,month, poutcome,y)

### 📦 2. Data Integrity & Structure

Q: Did you find any missing, duplicate, or incorrectly formatted entries in the dataset?  
-1) I did not find any missing values using isnull().sum() and additional check for unstructured placehodres(e.g., empty string,"n/a") returend 0 across all 17 column.
-2) I verified duplicated rows using .duplicated.sum() returened 0 duplicate rows.

-3) Some categorical variables (e.g., job. education,contact, putcome) included the category 'unknown', which effectively acts as a placeholder for misssing information.

Q: Are all data types appropriate for their features (e.g., numeric, categorical)?  
Yes, the datatset columns alinged with their expected types:
**##** Numeric(64):
(age, balance, day, duration, campaign,pdays,previous) all sorted as integers with no irregular formatting.
**##** Categorical(object): 
(job,martial,education, housing , loan,contact,month, poutcome,y) all stored as text labels.
